# nodeChat
Node JS Real-time Chat with Targeted User Functionality

A very simple UI

1. Enter nickname which will also be the username
2. Type the message in the chat box below to send to all the users connected to the group.
3. To send a message to specific user, type as follows: `@username <message>`. Example: `@Alex Hello there`
4. The message will only be sent to specified username.
5. This is enforced from server side so it is secure and reliable.

> Base code is forked from socket io example chat code.
